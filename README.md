## Criticism after submitting this work (not fixed)
- too much code in the ISR, this causes the ISR to not be finished in one milisecond. This causes some weird behaviour (example is in 3 the delay before the square moves smoothly)
- adding a function for sending 16Bit data wasnt intended. We should've just used the 8Bit send function for everything.
